# Banglore-Housing-Price-Prediction

# 🏡 House Price Prediction

This project uses machine learning to predict housing prices based on features like location, square footage, number of bathrooms, and BHK. It's designed to help homebuyers, real estate agents, and developers make smarter, data-driven decisions.

## 📌 Project Overview

We analyzed a real estate dataset, performed thorough data cleaning, and trained a regression model to estimate property prices. The final model was fine-tuned using `GridSearchCV` for optimal performance.

## 📊 Features Used

- `location`: Area or neighborhood
- `total_sqft`: Total square footage of the property
- `bath`: Number of bathrooms
- `bhk`: Number of bedrooms/halls/kitchens

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas & NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing

- Handled missing and inconsistent values
- Converted categorical features into numerical values
- Engineered new features 
- Removed outliers and duplicate entries

## 🤖 Model Building

Multiple regression models were tested, and the best one was selected using GridSearchCV. The final model offers solid predictive accuracy and was validated with real examples.

## 🧠 Key Insights

- Location plays a huge role in property price — even identical properties can have drastically different prices depending on where they are.
- Feature selection and outlier removal significantly improved the model's accuracy.


## ✅ Future Improvements

- Deploy the model using Flask or Streamlit
- Use more detailed geospatial data (e.g., coordinates, local amenities)
- Integrate with real-time property listings for live predictions
